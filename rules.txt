[Section 1]
<b>Board and Pieces</b></br>
Dara is played on a 6 x 5 board</br>
Other dimensions are possible, like 6 x 6</br>
Each of the 2 players has 12 pieces</br>
One player plays with blue pieces, the other with orange ones</br>
All 24 pieces are always visible, either on or off the board</br>
Pieces off the board are grouped by color, on each player's side</br>

[Section 2]
<b>Basic Rules</b></br>
Players choose a color and decide who plays first</br>
Initially, the board is empty</br>
The game has 2 phases:</br>
- Phase 1 - Drop the pieces</br>
- Phase 2 - Move the pieces</br>

[Section 3]
<b>In a Line</b></br>
Are considered in a line:</br>
- sequences of 3 or more contiguous pieces</br>
- horizontally or vertically (not diagonally)</br>
- all of the same color</br>

[Section 4]
<b>Placing the Pieces</b></br>
Players alternately place one of their pieces on an empty cell</br>
No more than 3 pieces can be placed in a line</br>
There can be 3 pieces in a line (but it's not advantageous)</br>

[Section 5]
<b>Moving the Pieces</b></br>
Each player alternately moves one piece of their color</br>
A piece can only be moved to an adjacent cell</br>
Pieces are moved only horizontally or vertically (not diagonally)</br>
A line of size 3 allows capturing an opponent's piece</br>
In this case, remove one of the opponent's pieces</br>
Only one piece is removed per move (even if multiple lines are formed)</br>
Lines with more than 3 pieces cannot be formed</br>
A piece cannot return to the cell it was on the previous move</br>
It can only return to that cell in the following moves</br>

[Section 6]
<b>End of the Game</b></br>
The game ends when a player cannot win</br>
For example, if they only have 2 pieces on the board</br>
Or if they cannot make a valid move</br>
The player who cannot win loses the game</br>
